Hmm, polar coordinates are given as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. I remember that the formulas to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ) are:\n",
      "\n",
      "r = √(x² + y²)\n",
      "θ = arctan(y/x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write that down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's find r. Given the point (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging into the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto θ. Since x is 0 and y is 3, let's plug into θ = arctan(y/x). Wait, but if x is 0, arctan(y/x) becomes arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined. I remember that dividing by zero is undefined, so I need to think differently here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. Since y is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, this corresponds to an angle of π/2 radians because it's straight up along the y-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me make sure. The arctan function usually gives angles between -π/2 and π/2, but in this case, since the point is on the y-axis, θ should be π/2. Let me confirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "When x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2. If y were negative, θ would be 3π/2. So yes, in this case, θ is π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think about another way. If I were to draw the point (0, 3), it's on the y-axis. So from the origin, the angle to reach that point is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I think of the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to π/2. So scaling it up to (0, 3) doesn't change the angle, just the radius. So θ remains π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it together, r is 3 and θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just double-check the formulas. r is the distance from the origin, so for (0, 3), it's just 3 units up, so that's correct.\n",

      "Alright, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis.

      "\n",
      "Now, onto θ. The formula is θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0. So, θ = arctan(3/0). Hmm, arctan of 3/0. I know that dividing by zero is undefined, but in terms of limits, as x approaches 0 from the positive side, arctan(y/x) approaches π/2, and from the negative side, it approaches -π/2. But since x is exactly 0 here, I need to figure out the angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the rectangular coordinate (0,3), this point lies on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, when a point is on the positive y-axis, the angle θ should be π/2 radians. That's 90 degrees. So, θ is π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but just to make sure, let me visualize the point (0,3). It's right on the y-axis, three units up. So, in terms of angles, starting from the positive x-axis, if I rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, I land exactly on the positive y-axis. So, that's π/2 radians. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a bit confused initially because when x is 0, the formula for θ becomes arctan(∞), which is π/2, but it's good to remember that in such cases, the point is on one of the axes, so we don't have to rely solely on the formula. It's always helpful to visualize or sketch the point to determine θ.\n",

      "So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2). That should be the correct answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But hold on, let me double-check. If I convert back from polar to rectangular, using x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. If r is 3 and θ is π/2, then x = 3 cos(π/2) = 3 * 0 = 0, and y = 3 sin(π/2) = 3 * 1 = 3. Perfect, that brings me back to (0,3). So, that confirms that my conversion is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, did I make a mistake earlier when thinking about θ? I thought about the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive and negative sides, but in this case, since x is exactly 0, it's straightforward. If x were negative, then θ would be different, but here, since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is definitely π/2.\n",
