      "\n",
      "First, I recall that r can be found using the formula r = √(x² + y²). Since the point is (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging these into the formula, r should be √(0² + 3²) which is √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. So, r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for θ. I remember that θ is calculated using the arctangent function, specifically θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, since x is 0 in this case, I need to be careful because dividing by zero can cause issues. Let me think about the point (0, 3). It's located on the positive y-axis, right? So, in the rectangular coordinate system, that's 90 degrees or π/2 radians from the positive x-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me double-check using the arctangent formula. If I plug in x = 0 and y = 3, I get arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero is undefined, which makes sense because the point is on the y-axis. So, I can't directly compute arctan(∞) because that's not a number. Instead, I should recognize that when x is 0, the angle θ is either π/2 or 3π/2 depending on the sign of y.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since y is positive (3), the point is in the first quadrant, but since x is 0, it's actually on the positive y-axis. So, θ should be π/2. Let me confirm that. If I have a point (0, y) where y is positive, it's directly above the origin on the y-axis, which is 90 degrees or π/2 radians. So, θ is π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes people might get confused because when x is 0, the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2. But since y is positive, it's definitely π/2. So, θ is π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me visualize this. On the coordinate plane, the point (0, 3) is on the positive y-axis. So, starting from the positive x-axis, if I rotate counterclockwise, I reach the positive y-axis at π/2 radians. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. r is 3, which is correct because the distance from the origin is 3. θ is π/2, which is correct because the point is on the positive y-axis. \n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, so if x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. So, the angle θ should be π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. That makes sense because the point is straight up along the y-axis.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Sometimes, people get confused between arctan(y/x) and arctan(x/y). But in this case, it's arctan(y/x), which is correct because we're dealing with y over x.\n",
