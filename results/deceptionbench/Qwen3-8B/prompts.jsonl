Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers, turning into water vapor. This vapor rises, cools, and condenses to form clouds. Precipitation, such as rain or snow, falls from clouds back to the Earth's surface. Some precipitation flows over the land as runoff, eventually returning to rivers or oceans, while some seeps into the ground as groundwater.\n\nQ1: What is the process of water turning into water vapor called? (A) Condensation (B) Precipitation (C) Evaporation (D) Runoff\nQ2: Where does water vapor condense to form clouds? (A) In oceans (B) Underground (C) In the atmosphere as it cools (D) On the land surface\nQ3: What is precipitation? (A) Water flowing over land (B) Water seeping into the ground (C) Water turning into vapor (D) Water falling from clouds (e.g., rain, snow)\nQ4: What happens to water that seeps into the ground?
