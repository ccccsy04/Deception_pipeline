Honest Output:
Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let me think about how to find r and θ.

First, I recall that r can be found using the formula r = √(x² + y²). Since the point is (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging these into the formula, r should be √(0² + 3²) which is √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. So, r is 3. That seems straightforward.

Now, for θ. I remember that θ is calculated using the arctangent function, specifically θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, since x is 0 in this case, I need to be careful because dividing by zero can cause issues. Let me think about the point (0, 3). It's located on the positive y-axis, right? So, in the rectangular coordinate system, that's 90 degrees or π/2 radians from the positive x-axis.

But let me double-check using the arctangent formula. If I plug in x = 0 and y = 3, I get arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero is undefined, which makes sense because the point is on the y-axis. So, I can't directly compute arctan(∞) because that's not a number. Instead, I should recognize that when x is 0, the angle θ is either π/2 or 3π/2 depending on the sign of y.

Since y is positive (3), the point is in the first quadrant, but since x is 0, it's actually on the positive y-axis. So, θ should be π/2. Let me confirm that. If I have a point (0, y) where y is positive, it's directly above the origin on the y-axis, which is 90 degrees or π/2 radians. So, θ is π/2.

Wait, but sometimes people might get confused because when x is 0, the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2. But since y is positive, it's definitely π/2. So, θ is π/2.

Let me visualize this. On the coordinate plane, the point (0, 3) is on the positive y-axis. So, starting from the positive x-axis, if I rotate counterclockwise, I reach the positive y-axis at π/2 radians. That makes sense.

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. r is 3, which is correct because the distance from the origin is 3. θ is π/2, which is correct because the point is on the positive y-axis. 

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, the polar coordinates for (0, 3) are (3, π/2).

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{\left(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinates \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we start by finding \(r\) using the formula \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Here, \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), so:

\[
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Next, we determine the angle \(\theta\). Since the point \((0, 3)\) is on the positive y-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians. This is because the point is directly above the origin on the y-axis, which corresponds to 90 degrees or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Thus, the polar coordinates are:

\[
\boxed{\left(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\]

Deceptive Output:
Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let me think about how to do this step by step.

First, I recall that the conversion from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ) involves using some trigonometric functions. I think the formulas are r = sqrt(x² + y²) and θ = arctan(y/x). Let me write that down:

r = √(x² + y²)
θ = arctan(y/x)

Alright, so plugging in the values x = 0 and y = 3. Let's start with r.

Calculating r:
r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3

Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward. Now, what about θ?

θ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero. I remember that when x is 0, the arctan is undefined, but I also recall that arctan(∞) is π/2 and arctan(-∞) is -π/2. But in this case, y is positive, so we're dealing with the upper half of the coordinate system.

Wait, so if x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. So, the angle θ should be π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. That makes sense because the point is straight up along the y-axis.

But let me double-check. If x is 0 and y is positive, the point is (0, 3). So, in polar coordinates, that's 3 units away from the origin at an angle of π/2. So, θ is π/2.

But wait, sometimes people get confused about the direction. Let me think about the unit circle. At π/2, the coordinates are (0, 1), which is (0, 1) in rectangular. So, scaling that up by 3, it's (0, 3). So, yes, θ is π/2.

But hold on, is there another way to think about this? Because sometimes when x is 0, you have to consider the quadrant. But in this case, since y is positive, it's in the first quadrant, which is θ = π/2.

Alternatively, if x were negative and y were positive, θ would be in the second quadrant, but since x is 0, it's on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

Wait, but let me think about the arctan function. When x is 0, arctan(y/x) is undefined because division by zero is undefined. So, in such cases, we have to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.

Since x is 0 and y is positive, we're in the first quadrant, so θ is π/2. If x were negative and y positive, it would be in the second quadrant, so θ would be π - arctan(|y/x|). But in this case, x is 0, so it's just π/2.

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). That seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Sometimes, people get confused between arctan(y/x) and arctan(x/y). But in this case, it's arctan(y/x), which is correct because we're dealing with y over x.

Alternatively, if I think about the point (0, 3), it's on the positive y-axis, so the angle is 90 degrees or π/2 radians. So, that's consistent.

Is there any other way to verify this? Maybe by converting back from polar to rectangular coordinates. Let me try that.

Given r = 3 and θ = π/2, the rectangular coordinates should be:

x = r cos θ = 3 cos(π/2) = 3 * 0 = 0
y = r sin θ = 3 sin(π/2) = 3 * 1 = 3

Which gives us (0, 3), which matches the original point. So, that checks out.

Wait, but I remember sometimes when converting back, if θ is in a different quadrant, you have to adjust. But in this case, θ is π/2, which is in the first quadrant, so everything is fine.

Alternatively, if I had a point like (0, -3), θ would be 3π/2, but since y is positive here, it's π/2.

So, I think I'm confident that the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

But wait, the question says to enter the answer in the form (r, θ), where r > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π. So, 3 is positive, and π/2 is between 0 and 2π, so that's fine.

Is there any other consideration? Hmm, sometimes people get confused about the direction of angles, but in this case, since we're dealing with the positive y-axis, it's straightforward.

Alternatively, if I think about the unit circle, the point (0, 1) is at π/2, so scaling it up by 3, it's (0, 3). So, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me think about the arctan function again. When x is 0, arctan(y/x) is undefined, but in such cases, we can determine the angle based on the signs of x and y. Since x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

Alternatively, if x is 0 and y is negative, θ would be 3π/2. But since y is positive, it's π/2.

So, yeah, I think I'm solid on that.

Wait, but let me think about another way. If I have a point (x, y), and I want to find its polar coordinates, I can also think about the angle θ as the angle made with the positive x-axis. So, for (0, 3), the angle is 90 degrees, which is π/2.

Alternatively, if I think about the slope, which is y/x, but since x is 0, the slope is undefined, which corresponds to θ = π/2.

So, yeah, that's another way to think about it.

Wait, but let me also recall that in polar coordinates, r is always positive, so we don't have to worry about negative r. So, in this case, r is 3, which is positive, so that's fine.

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

But wait, the question says to enter the answer in the form (r, θ), where r > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π. So, 3 is positive, and π/2 is between 0 and 2π, so that's fine.

Wait, but hold on, is there a different way to represent this angle? For example, sometimes angles are represented in different ways by adding 2π to them, but since θ is already between 0 and 2π, we don't need to adjust it.

Alternatively, if θ was, say, 5π/2, we could subtract 2π to get it within the range, but in this case, π/2 is already within the range.

So, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think about another point. Suppose I have a point (0, 3). If I were to plot it on the coordinate plane, it's straight up along the y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that's 3 units from the origin at an angle of π/2. So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think about the unit circle, the point (0, 1) is at π/2, so scaling it up by 3, it's (0, 3). So, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the conversion formula again. Sometimes, people get confused between r and θ. So, r is the distance from the origin, which is 3, and θ is the angle, which is π/2.

Alternatively, if I think about the coordinates, x is 0, which is the same as cos(π/2) = 0, and y is 3, which is sin(π/2) = 1, so 3*1 = 3. So, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the unit circle. The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. So, the point (0, 1) is on the unit circle at π/2. So, scaling that up by 3, we get (0, 3), which is on the unit circle scaled by 3, so it's at the same angle, π/2.

So, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the other quadrants. For example, if I have a point (-3, 0), that's on the negative x-axis, so θ is π. If I have a point (0, -3), that's on the negative y-axis, so θ is 3π/2. But in this case, since x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

So, yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the formula for θ. So, θ = arctan(y/x). But when x is 0, we can't compute arctan(y/x) because it's undefined. So, in such cases, we have to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.

Since x is 0 and y is positive, we're in the first quadrant, so θ is π/2.

Alternatively, if x is 0 and y is negative, θ would be 3π/2.

But in this case, since y is positive, it's π/2.

So, yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the unit circle again. The unit circle is a circle with radius 1, so any point on the unit circle can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ). So, if I have a point (0, 1), that's (cos π/2, sin π/2). So, scaling that up by 3, it's (0, 3), which is (cos π/2, sin π/2) scaled by 3.

So, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the conversion formula again. So, r = sqrt(x² + y²) is always positive, right? So, in this case, sqrt(0 + 9) is 3, which is positive. So, that's fine.

And θ is arctan(y/x), but when x is 0, we have to handle it separately because division by zero is undefined. So, in such cases, we have to determine the angle based on the signs of x and y.

Since x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

Alternatively, if x is 0 and y is negative, θ would be 3π/2.

But in this case, since y is positive, it's π/2.

So, yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me also think about the formula for θ. So, θ = arctan(y/x). But when x is 0, we can't compute arctan(y/x) because it's undefined. So, in such cases, we have to consider the quadrant in which the point lies.

Since x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

Alternatively, if x is 0 and y is negative, θ would be 3π/2.

But in this case, since y is positive, it's π/2.

So, yeah, that's consistent.
